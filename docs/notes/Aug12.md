# Discussion notes August 12

### note taker: Peter J

<hr>

Action items for Tuesday Aug 13:

1. Lund/CA diagram for pp collisions from all available models
   * Jet reco: Anti-kT, R=0.4
   * Jet reclustering: CA
   * Follow hardest prong
   * plot at both parton and hadron levels
   
2. EMMI diagram for same simluations
   * plot log(1/z) vs log(1/theta)
   * likewise at both parton and hadronl levels

<hr>

Notes on the chalkboard:

1. Calibration of jet models: comparison to standard data
   * inclusive jet and hadron distributions
   * pp and A+A

2. Calibration of hydro models: comparison to standard data
   * done at sufficient level by Uli's talk
   
3. Comparison of medium recoil meachnisms in different models

4. Q-PYTHIA for RHIC
   * Liliana: can be done over night
   
5. JETSCAPE for RHIC
   * James: significant technical issue with hydro background for Au+Au at 200 GeV
   * under discussion whether this is achievable this week
   
6. Integration of Saclay Model
   * request by Paul C for collaboration
   
7. Does the SD/CA procedure find the first hard splitting in practice?
   * Compare: shower record; SD @ parton level; SD @ hadron level
   * check event-by-event tagging probability vs agreement at ensemble-averaged level
   * pp @ RHIC and LHC; A+A?
   * Change beta and clustering algorithm in SD
   
8. Evt generation for differnt models with common hydro background?
   * XNW: choice of background modle can potentially generate large effects
   
9. Hadronization and substructure: how to test effects?
   * compare observables @ parton vs hadron levels
   * PYTHIA vs HERWIG
   
10. Couple SMASH to shower/quench models
