# Summary discussion - Friday afternoon

Following are the bullets that Peter wrote on the board

<hr>

Connection of shower history to observables
   * correlation of hardest kt split in shower vs SD split
   
Initial vaidation at this workshop was successful for some parts of phase space
   * reclustering via both CA and kT appears to be effective  
   * comprehesive validation effort ongoing
   * RHIC is (much) more difficult than LHC
   
Primary utility as event tagger: what is correlated with split of given kt?
   * suggested correlations to explore: mass, jet shape

Closure/consistency test in progress for AA via embedding; is crucial next step
   * JETSCAPE framework is important for realistic simulations, experimental projections
   
Is the max(kt) selection theoretically robust?

Interpreting splitting in terms of tf: comparison of different models is a valuable tool
   * pp: comparison of PYTHIA and HERWIG will continue to be useful

Lund planes: many different flavors and labeling; we need to establish precise definitions

RHIC/LHC comparisons are important; identify measurable regions for each

Need to quantify resolutions, in particular the R-dependence

Sub-leading splittings: indications that this can work in selected phase space but more study is needed

Grooming: what gets removed? The EMMI diagram will be a useful tool to study this

Proposal for simplified Lund Plane: start with single parton and let it shower. This will allow study of the shower 
dynamics without confusion with other processes
