# Summary discussion - Friday afternoon

Following are the bullets that Peter wrote on the board

<hr>

Connection of shower history to observables
   * correlation of hardest kt split in shower vs SD split
   
Initial validation at this workshop was successful for some parts of phase space
   * reclustering via both CA and kT appears to be effective  
   * comprehesive validation effort ongoing
   * RHIC is (much) more difficult than LHC
   * Crucial to validate with accurate dynamical background models (Core-Corona, JETSCAPE,...)
   
Primary utility as event tagger: what is correlated with split of given kt?

Suggested correlations to explore: 
   * mass
   * jet shape
   * EMMI plot
   * may allow to disentagle effects of tf and mass

Closure/consistency test in progress for AA via embedding; is crucial next step
   * JETSCAPE framework is important for realistic simulations, experimental projections
   
Is the max(kt) selection theoretically robust?

Interpreting splitting in terms of tf: 
   * comparison of different models is a valuable tool; e.g. LBT vs MATTER/MARTINI incorprate different assumptions about time ordering
   * pp: comparison of PYTHIA and HERWIG will continue to be useful

Lund planes: many different flavors and labeling; we need to establish precise definitions

RHIC/LHC comparisons are important; identify measurable regions for each

Need to quantify resolutions, in particular the R-dependence

Sub-leading splittings: indications that this can work in selected phase space but more study is needed

Grooming: 
   * what gets removed? The EMMI plot will be a useful tool to study this
   * very important in-medium; needs optimization

Proposal for simplified Lund Plane: start with single parton and let it shower. This will allow study of the shower 
dynamics without confusion with other processes

EMMI plot combines Frag Fn and jet shape - unique information

Proposal to rename EMMI plot: "2-d jet profile"

Big picture: we are interested in the space-time development of the shower because we are interested in the medium and its response
   * medium response wil necessarily distort and confuse the Lund Plane analysis
   * Lund Plane therefore provides valuable design tools for modeling of medium response and comparing to data
   
Experiment now has many knobs to turn and observables to utilize as taggers
   * how to use them? Needs guidance from theory and modeling
   * as always, biases must be undrestood and controlled
   
While validatation of the correlation of max(kt) betweem shower map and Jet Lund Plane is encouraging, the in-practice experimental implementation remains very challenging
   * crucial to determine practically accessible phase space
   * control background corrections and biases

Big picture: how do we study the scattering centers and learn about the quasi-particles of the QGP?
   * rare scatterings in kT tail
   * 2nd Lund Plane?
   * relate to acoplanarity measurements
   * study correlations in quenching models
