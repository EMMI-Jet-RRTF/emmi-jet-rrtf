# Discussion notes Aug 13 morning

## Plot formatting

Agree on a common set up for Lund and EMMI plots: obsrevables, scaling, formatting
   * normalize per jet
   * logarithmic z-scale
   * label of each figure should fully decsribe content
   * same dynamic range for all plots (both RHIC and LHC)

Lund: 
   * vertical axis: log(kt/GeV)
   * vertical axis dynamic range: [-3, 5]  (??)
   * horiz axis: log(1/$\Delta${R})
   * horiz axis dynamic range: [0,6] (??)
   
EMMI:
   * vertical axis: log(1/z)
   * vertical axis dynamic range: [0,10] (??)
   * horiz axis: log(1/$\Delta${R})
   * horiz axis dynamic range: [0,6] (??)
   
## Comments on EMMI diagrams

Most useful is the difference plot AA - pp
   * needs sufficient statistical precision - do we have that?
   
Study effects of hadronization: 
   *look at difference plot PYTHIA-Herwig for pp collisions

xxxx under construction

Gui: concerned that comparison of AA and pp means comparing jets with different primordial kinematics. Proposed solution: use gamma+jet population.



Agreement on kinematics:

Incl jets:
•	RHIC: pTjet>15, 40 GeV (pThat=10, 35 GeV); |eta_jet|<1
•	LHC: pTjet>70, 350 GeV (pThat=50, 300 GeV); |eta_jet|<2

Read initial parton energy from HEPMC record
Separate q/g

Gamma+jet…?
•	|delta_phi – pi| < 0.6
•	pTgamma > 100 GeV
•	look for hardest recoil jet 
•	pTjet > 30 GeV
