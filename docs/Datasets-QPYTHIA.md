## Q-PYTHIA

Final state events (at hadron level, no recoils), in HepMC 2 format, available at:

`/lustre/emmi/emmi08/q-pythia-emmi/`

For now, only central [0-10]% LHC events (5.02 TeV), for dijets and Z+jet. 
There are also available 2 ptHats (50 GeV and 300 GeV) and they are easily recognised by the folder name:

`lhc_dijets300_hadron` (for dijets with ptHat = 300 GeV)

`lhc_dijets50_hadron` (for dijets with ptHat = 50 GeV)

`lhc_zjet300_hadron` (for z+jet with ptHat = 300 GeV)

`lhc_zjet50_hadron` (for z+jet with ptHat = 50 GeV)

For each setup, there will be 40 files (summing a total of 0.8M events) of vacuum reference (`qpythia_vac_XX.hepmc`) and quenched events (`qpythia_qhat2_XX.hepmc`).
